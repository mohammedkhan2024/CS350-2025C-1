# Milestone Three

### Summary:
- The milestone involves a program that controls an LED to blink while simultaneously listening for button presses and using a separate thread for the LED blinking to avoid blocking the main program. It also uses a 16x2 display to provide debugging information to the user.

### What I Did Well:
- Successfully implemented multithreading to allow the LED blinking and button press detection to occur concurrently. Also, I created a debugging system using the 16x2 display, which is helpful when a console is not available.

### Where I Could Improve: 
- Integration of serial communications could be improved to dynamically change the messages available to the program which would enhance its adaptability.

### Tools/Resources to Add: 
- I would add tools and resources on implementing serial communication protocols such as UART or SPI.

### Transferable Skills: 
- Multithreading, hardware interfacing, debugging techniques, and state management are skills that are transferable to other projects and coursework.

### Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable:
Readability is enhanced through the use of the 16x2 display for debugging. Adaptability is achieved through potential serial communication integration.

# Final Project - Thermostat State Machine

### Summary: 
- The project simulates a thermostat using a state machine model to control temperature.

### What I Did Well:
- I successfully modeled the thermostat's behavior using a state machine and created a clear and organized structure for managing its different states and transitions.

### Where I Could Improve:
-  I could improve the project by adding more complex states and conditions to simulate a more realistic thermostat, such as incorporating time based settings or learning algorithms.

### Tool/Reasources to Add:
- I would add a framework for creating state machines to manage different states and transitions.

### Transferable Skills:
- State machine design, embedded systems programming, understanding of different microcontroller architectures, and cloud connectivity are transferable skills.

### Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable:
- The state machine framework provides structure, triggers, transitions, event listeners, and persistency which makes the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
